## 0. How to read this document

The spec is _what_ the D/W bot does. This plan is _how_ and _in what order_ we build it. The plan is decomposed into **15 epics** containing concrete **stories** with explicit **acceptance criteria** (ACs).

This plan **assumes Luck's foundation work is already done** — the monorepo skeleton, Postgres compose, `core` schemas, audit log with hash chain, base CI, and shared `goldrush_core` modules are inherited from Luck's plan. Where D/W needs additions to a shared component, the story makes that explicit.

### Conventions

- **Story format:** "As X I want Y so that Z" + concrete description + ACs.
- **AC format:** observable, testable assertions.
- **Definition of Done** for every story:
  1. Code merged to `main` via PR with passing CI (lint, mypy strict, pip-audit, tests, coverage gates).
  2. All ACs verified.
  3. Relevant docs updated in the same PR.
  4. Commit message clean — no AI/generator attribution; author is Aleix.
- **Effort sizing:** S, M, L, XL.
- **Spec refs:** every story cross-references the relevant section(s) of the design spec.
- **Dependencies:** a story can only start when its dependencies are Done.

### Top-level phase ordering

```
Phase 1 (Foundation extensions)     → Epic 1, 2
Phase 2 (Core services & models)    → Epic 3
Phase 3 (Bot skeleton)              → Epic 4
Phase 4 (Money flows)               → Epic 5, 6  (deposit and withdraw can parallelise)
Phase 5 (Cashier system)            → Epic 7
Phase 6 (Background workers)        → Epic 8
Phase 7 (Disputes & blacklist)      → Epic 9
Phase 8 (Admin commands)            → Epic 10
Phase 9 (Observability)             → Epic 11
Phase 10 (Operations & deploy)      → Epic 12
Phase 11 (Documentation final pass) → Epic 13
Phase 12 (Testing)                  → Epic 14   (incremental throughout, finalised here)
Phase 13 (Launch)                   → Epic 15
```

Epics 5 and 6 can parallelise after Epic 4 is done. Epic 8 (background workers) can start as soon as the relevant tables exist (Epic 2). Documentation grows incrementally and gets a final pass in Epic 13.

## EPIC 1 — Foundation extensions for D/W

### Story 1.1 — Extend the monorepo skeleton with the `goldrush_deposit_withdraw` package

**Status:** Done (2026-05-01)

**As Aleix I want** the D/W package shaped from day one **so that** every later PR adds code, not directories.

**ACs:**
- [x] `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/{tickets,cashiers,commands,views,setup}/__init__.py` exist.
- [x] `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/__main__.py`, `client.py`, `healthcheck.py` placeholders exist.
- [x] `python -c "import goldrush_deposit_withdraw"` succeeds.
- [x] `tests/{unit,integration,property,e2e}/dw/` directories exist with `__init__.py` and a smoke test that imports the package.
- [x] `.gitignore` updated to exclude `dwBotKeys.txt`, `luckBotKeys.txt`, `*Keys.txt`, `*keys.txt`, `*.token`, `secrets/`, `.env`, `.env.*` (anywhere in the tree).
- [x] `.gitignore` audited: `git check-ignore -v dwBotKeys.txt` reports it ignored.

**Dependencies:** Luck Epic 1 (monorepo skeleton in place)
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §2.1

### Story 1.2 — D/W-specific dependencies (none new at runtime)

**As Aleix I want** D/W to share the runtime dependencies of Luck **so that** we keep one lockfile and one image base.

**ACs:**
- [ ] No new entries needed in `pyproject.toml` runtime deps for D/W (all usage is covered by `discord.py`, `asyncpg`, `SQLAlchemy`, `pydantic`, `structlog`, `Pillow`, `prometheus-client`).
- [ ] `Makefile` adds targets `run-dev-dw`, `test-dw-unit`, `test-dw-integration`.
- [ ] `uv.lock` unchanged.

**Dependencies:** Story 1.1
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §1.1

### Story 1.3 — CI pipeline extensions

**As Aleix I want** D/W coverage gates enforced in CI **so that** the bot's quality stays at fintech-grade.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds: `mypy --strict goldrush_deposit_withdraw`.
- [ ] Coverage gates added: `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/tickets ≥ 95 %`, `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/cashiers ≥ 90 %`, `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/commands/admin_cog.py ≥ 90 %`, rest of `goldrush_deposit_withdraw ≥ 85 %`.
- [ ] CI fails if any gate is missed.
- [ ] Cross-bot integration tests run on every PR (testcontainers Postgres).

**Dependencies:** Story 1.1, Luck Story 1.3
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §8.3, §8.4, §8.5

## EPIC 2 — Database schema additions

### Story 2.1 — Migration: `dw` schema and grants

**As Aleix I want** the `dw` schema with correct grants in place **so that** every later migration adds tables without DDL ceremony.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Alembic migration `dw_001_create_schema_and_grants.py` creates schema `dw`.
- [ ] Grants per spec §3.1 applied for `goldrush_dw`, `goldrush_readonly`.
- [ ] Adds `INSERT, UPDATE` on `core.users`, `core.balances` to `goldrush_dw`.
- [ ] Adds `INSERT` on `core.audit_log` to `goldrush_dw`.
- [ ] Test: connect as `goldrush_dw`, run `INSERT INTO core.users` — succeeds.
- [ ] Test: connect as `goldrush_luck`, run `INSERT INTO core.users` — fails with permission denied.

**Dependencies:** Luck Epic 2 done
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.1

### Story 2.2 — Migration: `dw.deposit_tickets` and `dw.withdraw_tickets`

**As Aleix I want** the two ticket tables with their indexes and terminal-state immutability triggers **so that** the lifecycle state machine is enforced at the DB level.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Migration creates both tables exactly per spec §3.2.
- [ ] All `CHECK` constraints enforced.
- [ ] All indexes created.
- [ ] Terminal-state-immutable trigger on each table; integration test: a `confirmed` row cannot be updated to `claimed`.
- [ ] Test: insert `claimed` row, update to `cancelled` — succeeds. Insert `confirmed` row, update to `claimed` — raises.
- [ ] SQLAlchemy ORM models added in `goldrush_core/models/dw.py`.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.1
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.2

### Story 2.3 — Migration: cashier tables

**As Aleix I want** the four cashier tables in place **so that** cashier registration, status, sessions, and stats can be implemented.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Migration creates `dw.cashier_characters`, `dw.cashier_status`, `dw.cashier_sessions`, `dw.cashier_stats` per spec §3.2.
- [ ] All check constraints and indexes per spec.
- [ ] Test: register two chars for one cashier; UNIQUE constraint blocks a third identical entry.
- [ ] SQLAlchemy ORM models added.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.1
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.2

### Story 2.4 — Migration: disputes, dynamic embeds, global config

**As Aleix I want** the supporting tables in place **so that** disputes, editable embeds, and runtime config are persistable.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Migration creates `dw.disputes`, `dw.dynamic_embeds`, `dw.global_config` per spec §3.2.
- [ ] `dw.global_config` seeded with the 12 default keys from spec §3.2 (min/max amounts, fees, timeouts).
- [ ] Test: re-running the seed is idempotent (no duplicate rows).

**Dependencies:** Story 2.1
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.2

### Story 2.5 — Treasury system row

**As Aleix I want** the treasury row to exist after migration **so that** every fee credit has a target.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Migration ensures `core.users (discord_id=0)` and `core.balances (discord_id=0, balance=0)` exist (idempotent INSERT ... ON CONFLICT).
- [ ] Test: `SELECT 1 FROM core.balances WHERE discord_id=0` returns 1 after migration.

**Dependencies:** Luck Story 2.4
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.1, §4.6

### Story 2.6 — SECURITY DEFINER deposit fns

**As Aleix I want** `dw.create_deposit_ticket`, `dw.confirm_deposit`, `dw.cancel_deposit` **so that** every deposit-side gold movement is encoded in DB code, not application code.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Three functions created per spec §3.3, owned by `goldrush_admin`, `EXECUTE` granted to `goldrush_dw`.
- [ ] `confirm_deposit` is idempotent on `core.users` insert (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- [ ] `confirm_deposit` writes one `audit_log` row with `action='deposit_confirmed'`, signed amount, balance_before/after.
- [ ] Test: `apply` then `confirm` for a brand-new user creates the user and credits balance correctly.
- [ ] Test: only the cashier who claimed can call `confirm_deposit` (function checks `claimed_by == p_cashier_id`).
- [ ] Test: connecting as `goldrush_dw` and trying `UPDATE core.balances SET balance=...` directly returns permission denied; only EXECUTE on the function works.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.2, Story 2.5
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3

### Story 2.7 — SECURITY DEFINER withdraw fns

**As Aleix I want** `dw.create_withdraw_ticket`, `dw.confirm_withdraw`, `dw.cancel_withdraw` **so that** withdraw side enforces lock/finalise/refund correctly.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Three functions per spec §3.3.
- [ ] `create_withdraw_ticket` locks balance: validates `balance >= amount`, then `balance -= amount, locked_balance += amount`. Captures `fee = amount * withdraw_fee_bps / 10000` at creation.
- [ ] `confirm_withdraw`: `locked_balance -= amount`; treasury (`core.balances[0].balance += fee`); ticket `amount_delivered = amount - fee, status=confirmed`; audit log row.
- [ ] `cancel_withdraw`: full refund (`balance += amount, locked_balance -= amount`); audit row.
- [ ] Test: lock + confirm: user balance drops by amount, treasury grows by fee.
- [ ] Test: lock + cancel: user balance restored exactly, no orphan in `locked_balance`.
- [ ] Property test: any sequence of (lock, confirm, cancel) for one user keeps `balance >= 0` and `locked_balance >= 0` always.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.2, Story 2.5
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §4.2

### Story 2.8 — SECURITY DEFINER lifecycle fns

**As Aleix I want** `dw.claim_ticket`, `dw.release_ticket` **so that** assignment is atomic.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `claim_ticket` validates region match against `dw.cashier_characters` for that cashier; raises `region_mismatch` if no compatible char.
- [ ] `claim_ticket` raises `already_claimed` if status != 'open'.
- [ ] `release_ticket` only allows the current `claimed_by` to release.
- [ ] Test: 100 parallel `claim_ticket` calls on same ticket — exactly one succeeds.
- [ ] Test: cashier with only EU char tries to claim NA ticket — raises `region_mismatch`.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.2, Story 2.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §5.1

### Story 2.9 — SECURITY DEFINER cashier-management fns

**As Aleix I want** `dw.add_cashier_character`, `dw.remove_cashier_character`, `dw.set_cashier_status` **so that** cashier mgmt is mediated by validated functions.

**ACs:**
- [ ] Three functions per spec §3.3.
- [ ] `add_cashier_character` enforces UNIQUE; duplicate raises `duplicate_character`.
- [ ] `remove_cashier_character` is soft-delete (`is_active=false, removed_at=NOW`).
- [ ] `set_cashier_status` upserts in `dw.cashier_status` and manages `dw.cashier_sessions`: when transitioning to/from `online`, opens/closes a session row.
- [ ] Test: `online → offline` closes the session row with `duration_s` populated.
- [ ] Test: `online → break` closes the online session, opens a break session.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §4.3

### Story 2.10 — SECURITY DEFINER dispute fns

**ACs:**
- [ ] `dw.open_dispute(ticket_type, ticket_uid, opener_id, opener_role, reason)` per spec.
- [ ] `dw.resolve_dispute(dispute_id, action, amount?, resolved_by)` supports actions: `refund`, `force-confirm`, `partial-refund:<amount>`, `no-action`. Refund actions internally call the relevant `cancel_*` or `treasury_withdraw_to_user` fn.
- [ ] All resolution paths write audit rows.
- [ ] Test: open dispute on a confirmed withdraw → resolve as `refund` → user balance restored, treasury debited.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.4, Story 2.7
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §4.5

### Story 2.11 — SECURITY DEFINER treasury fns

**As Aleix I want** `dw.treasury_sweep` and `dw.treasury_withdraw_to_user` **so that** every treasury movement is auditable and atomic.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `treasury_sweep(amount, admin_id, reason)`: validates `treasury.balance >= amount`; debits treasury; writes audit row `action='treasury_swept'`. Does not touch any other balance.
- [ ] `treasury_withdraw_to_user(amount, target_user_id, admin_id, reason)`: validates treasury sufficiency; debits treasury; credits user; writes audit row.
- [ ] Test: sweep more than treasury balance → raises `insufficient_treasury`.
- [ ] Test: invariant property — after any sequence of deposits, withdraws, sweeps, refunds, `SUM(user_balances) + treasury_balance + total_swept = total_ever_deposited`.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.5
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §4.6

### Story 2.12 — Migration: ban-user fns and `core.users.banned` integration

**ACs:**
- [ ] `dw.ban_user(user_id, reason, admin_id)` flips `core.users.banned=true, banned_reason, banned_at=NOW`; writes audit row.
- [ ] `dw.unban_user(user_id, admin_id)` reverts.
- [ ] Bot's `/deposit` and `/withdraw` commands check `core.users.banned`; reject with ephemeral embed if true.
- [ ] Test: banned user invokes `/deposit` → ephemeral "You are blacklisted" message.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.4
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3, §6.4

## EPIC 3 — Core services & models

### Story 3.1 — Balance manager: D/W extensions

**ACs:**
- [ ] `goldrush_core/balance/dw_manager.py` exposes typed wrappers around the SECURITY DEFINER fns.
- [ ] Functions: `apply_deposit_ticket`, `confirm_deposit`, `cancel_deposit`, `apply_withdraw_ticket`, `confirm_withdraw`, `cancel_withdraw`, `treasury_sweep`, `treasury_withdraw_to_user`.
- [ ] Each translates Postgres `RaiseError` into typed Python exceptions (`InsufficientBalance`, `RegionMismatch`, `WrongCashier`, `TicketAlreadyClaimed`, `InsufficientTreasury`, `UserBanned`).
- [ ] Test: each exception type triggered by the corresponding DB error.

**Dependencies:** Epic 2 done
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §3.3

### Story 3.2 — Pydantic models for tickets and cashier characters

**ACs:**
- [ ] `goldrush_core/models/dw_pydantic.py` defines `DepositTicket`, `WithdrawTicket`, `CashierCharacter`, `CashierStatus`, `Dispute`, `DepositModalInput`, `WithdrawModalInput`, `EditDynamicEmbedInput` per spec §5.5.
- [ ] All input models enforce strict validation (region in {EU,NA}, faction in {Alliance,Horde}, charname regex, amount as exact integer, etc.).
- [ ] Test: malformed input raises pydantic ValidationError.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.2, Story 2.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.5

### Story 3.3 — Embed builders for D/W

**ACs:**
- [ ] `goldrush_core/embeds/dw_tickets.py` exposes the 14 builders listed in spec §5.6.
- [ ] All themed with the GoldRush palette (Win/Bust/Gold/Ember/House from Luck §6.3).
- [ ] Snapshot tests for each embed (title, fields, colour, footer).

**Dependencies:** Luck Story 4.10
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.6

### Story 3.4 — `/admin setup` channel factory

**As Aleix I want** the channel-creation logic isolated and testable **so that** the `/admin setup` command can be exercised in tests without a real Discord guild.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/setup/channel_factory.py` exposes `setup_or_reuse_channels(guild, dry_run=False) -> SetupReport`.
- [ ] Idempotent: if a category or channel already exists by name+parent, reuses it; never creates duplicates.
- [ ] Applies the canonical permission overwrites per spec §5.3 matrix.
- [ ] On real run, persists every channel id into `dw.global_config`.
- [ ] Returns a `SetupReport` with per-channel `created` / `reused` flag for the preview embed.
- [ ] Test (with discord.py mock): on a fresh mock guild, creates 2 categories + 8 channels with correct overwrites.
- [ ] Test: re-running on the same mock state reuses everything; no new entities created.

**Dependencies:** Story 3.2
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.3

---

## EPIC 4 — Bot skeleton

### Story 4.1 — Bot client + healthcheck

**ACs:**
- [ ] `goldrush_deposit_withdraw/__main__.py` builds the bot, logs "ready", runs forever.
- [ ] `client.py` defines `Bot` subclass; `setup_hook` connects DB pool with `goldrush_dw` role and loads cogs.
- [ ] `healthcheck.py` opens DB pool, runs `SELECT 1`, exits 0 on success.
- [ ] Docker `HEALTHCHECK` uses this script.

**Dependencies:** Epic 3 done
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.7

### Story 4.2 — Cog loading + per-guild sync

**ACs:**
- [ ] Loads all cogs from `EXTENSIONS` constant: `deposit_cog`, `withdraw_cog`, `ticket_cog`, `cashier_cog`, `admin_cog`, `account_cog`.
- [ ] `on_ready` syncs `bot.tree` to `discord.Object(id=GUILD_ID)`.
- [ ] Logs include synced command count.

**Dependencies:** Story 4.1
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.7

### Story 4.3 — Account cog: `/balance` and `/help`

**As a user I want** to inspect my balance and ask for help **so that** I do not need to leave Discord.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `/balance` posts ephemeral embed: balance, total deposited (sum of confirmed deposits), total withdrawn, lifetime fee paid.
- [ ] If the user has no `core.users` row → shows the `no_balance_embed` redirecting to `#how-to-deposit`.
- [ ] `/help topic?` lists deposit, withdraw, fairness, support topics.

**Dependencies:** Story 4.2, Story 3.1
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.1, §5.6

### Story 4.4 — Welcome dynamic embeds (`#how-to-deposit`, `#how-to-withdraw`)

**ACs:**
- [ ] On startup, bot ensures `dw.dynamic_embeds` has rows for `how_to_deposit` and `how_to_withdraw`; seeds default content if absent.
- [ ] If `message_id IS NULL`, posts the embed in the configured channel and stores the message id.
- [ ] If `message_id IS NOT NULL`, edits the existing message (in case content was updated).
- [ ] Test: deleting the stored message and restarting re-creates it; restarting twice does not duplicate.

**Dependencies:** Story 4.2, Story 3.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.6

### Story 4.5 — Online cashiers live embed

**ACs:**
- [ ] On startup, bot ensures `#online-cashiers` has the live embed message; creates if absent.
- [ ] Background task `online_cashiers_embed_updater` edits the message every 30 s with current online cashiers grouped by region (EU / NA), plus a "On break" subsection and an "Offline cashiers: N" footer line.
- [ ] Test: with two mock cashiers online (one EU, one NA), the embed renders both in the correct sections.

**Dependencies:** Story 4.4
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.6, §4.4

---

## EPIC 5 — Deposit flow

### Story 5.1 — `/deposit` command + DepositModal

**ACs:**
- [ ] Slash command `/deposit` registered, restricted to `#deposit` channel via `@require_channel`.
- [ ] On invocation, opens `DepositModal` with 5 fields per spec §5.5.
- [ ] On submit, pydantic validates input (region, faction, amount range, charname).
- [ ] If user is banned → ephemeral `You are blacklisted` embed; no ticket created.
- [ ] Rate limit applied: max 1 deposit-ticket-creation per user per 60 s.
- [ ] On valid input, calls `dw.create_deposit_ticket` SECURITY DEFINER fn.
- [ ] Test: malformed amount (`"50,000"`) → ValidationError; ephemeral error embed.
- [ ] Test: amount below min → ephemeral "Amount must be ≥ 200 G".
- [ ] Test: amount above max → ephemeral "Amount must be ≤ 200,000 G".

**Dependencies:** Story 2.6, Story 4.2
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.1, §5.1, §5.5

### Story 5.2 — Deposit thread creation + initial embed

**ACs:**
- [ ] After `dw.create_deposit_ticket` returns, bot creates a private thread in `#deposit` parent: `name = "deposit-{N}"`, `type = private_thread`, `invitable = false`, `auto_archive_duration = 1440`.
- [ ] Thread ID persisted in the `dw.deposit_tickets.thread_id` column (passed to the create fn).
- [ ] User is added to thread (`thread.add_user(...)`).
- [ ] Bot posts `deposit_ticket_open_embed` in the thread + a message mentioning `@cashier` role to surface the thread.
- [ ] Test: thread created with correct visibility and invited user.

**Dependencies:** Story 5.1, Story 3.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §5.4

### Story 5.3 — Cashier alert ping in `#cashier-alerts`

**ACs:**
- [ ] After thread created, bot posts a `cashier_alert_embed` in `#cashier-alerts` mentioning `@cashier`, with thread link.
- [ ] Embed shows: ticket UID, amount, char/realm/region, "compatible cashiers: <list>" if any cashier has matching region char online.
- [ ] Test: with one EU cashier online and an EU ticket, embed lists that cashier as compatible.

**Dependencies:** Story 5.2
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §C.4 (Section C of design)

### Story 5.4 — `/claim`, `/release`, `/cancel` for deposit tickets

**ACs:**
- [ ] `/claim` (in deposit thread): calls `dw.claim_ticket('deposit', uid, user_id)`; on success, edits the open embed to `deposit_ticket_claimed_embed`. Failure cases handled with ephemeral errors (`region_mismatch`, `already_claimed`).
- [ ] `/release` (in deposit thread, claimed by me): calls `dw.release_ticket`; restores `claimed=false` and re-pings cashiers.
- [ ] `/cancel reason:str` (in deposit thread, claimed by me): calls `dw.cancel_deposit`; embeds final cancelled embed; archives thread.
- [ ] `/cancel-mine` (in deposit thread, owned by me): only if status='open' (no claim yet); calls `dw.cancel_deposit`; archives thread.
- [ ] Test: cashier A claims, cashier B `/cancel` fails with `wrong_cashier`.

**Dependencies:** Story 5.2, Story 2.6, Story 2.8
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.1

### Story 5.5 — `/confirm` for deposit + 2FA modal

**ACs:**
- [ ] `/confirm` (in deposit thread, claimed by me): opens `ConfirmTicketModal` with magic word "CONFIRM".
- [ ] On submit with mismatched word, ephemeral "Confirmation cancelled".
- [ ] On submit with correct word, calls `dw.confirm_deposit`; on success, posts `deposit_ticket_confirmed_embed` showing the new balance; archives the thread.
- [ ] Updates `cashier_stats` (incremented inside the SECURITY DEFINER fn).
- [ ] Test: typing "confirm" (lowercase) → rejected. Typing "CONFIRM" → accepted.

**Dependencies:** Story 5.4, Story 2.6
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.1, §5.5

---

## EPIC 6 — Withdraw flow

### Story 6.1 — `/withdraw` command + WithdrawModal + balance lock

**ACs:**
- [ ] Slash command `/withdraw` restricted to `#withdraw` channel.
- [ ] WithdrawModal: same 5 fields as deposit.
- [ ] On submit, pydantic validates; bot fetches user balance; if `balance < amount` → ephemeral "Insufficient balance" with current balance shown.
- [ ] If valid, calls `dw.create_withdraw_ticket`. The fn locks balance (`balance -= amount, locked_balance += amount`) and inserts ticket with `fee` captured.
- [ ] Test: user with 10,000 G balance tries `/withdraw 50000` → ephemeral insufficient + no balance change.
- [ ] Test: user with 100,000 G balance and `/withdraw 50,000` → balance drops to 50,000, locked_balance becomes 50,000, ticket row inserted.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.7, Story 4.2
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.2, §5.1, §5.5

### Story 6.2 — Withdraw thread creation + initial embed (with fee breakdown)

**ACs:**
- [ ] Same thread-creation logic as deposit, in `#withdraw` parent.
- [ ] Initial embed shows: amount (gross), fee (2 %), `amount_delivered` = amount − fee (what cashier will trade ingame), char/realm/region/faction.
- [ ] Test: 50,000 G withdraw → embed shows 50,000 / 1,000 fee / 49,000 delivered.

**Dependencies:** Story 6.1, Story 3.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.2, §5.6

### Story 6.3 — `/claim`, `/release`, `/cancel`, `/cancel-mine` for withdraw

**ACs:**
- [ ] Symmetric to deposit Story 5.4 but with `dw.cancel_withdraw` for cancellation paths (which refunds the locked balance).
- [ ] Test: lock 50K → cancel → balance restored to original; locked_balance back to zero.

**Dependencies:** Story 6.2, Story 2.7
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.2

### Story 6.4 — `/confirm` for withdraw + 2FA + treasury credit

**ACs:**
- [ ] Same 2FA modal flow as deposit, but on success calls `dw.confirm_withdraw`: finalises lock as deduction, credits fee to treasury.
- [ ] Final embed shows `withdraw_ticket_confirmed_embed`: "Withdrawn 50,000 G · Received 49,000 G ingame · 1,000 G fee".
- [ ] Test: confirm flow ends with user `balance` reduced by 50K total, `locked_balance` zero, treasury balance increased by 1K.

**Dependencies:** Story 6.3, Story 2.7
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.2, §5.5, §5.6

### Story 10.4 — `/admin promote-cashier`, `/admin demote-cashier`, `/admin force-cashier-offline`

**ACs:**
- [ ] `promote-cashier @user` adds the `@cashier` role to the user (if bot has `Manage Roles` — wait, we don't grant that; alternative: explicit via Discord settings, command is just a reminder). Document this in the command output if Manage Roles is missing.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `treasury-balance` ephemeral shows current treasury balance with note "actual gold lives in the in-game guild bank".
- [ ] `treasury-sweep amount reason` opens 2FA modal expecting "SWEEP" + re-typed amount; on success, calls `dw.treasury_sweep`; webhook alert to `#alerts`.
- [ ] `treasury-withdraw-to-user amount user reason` opens 2FA modal expecting "TREASURY-WITHDRAW" + re-typed amount + re-typed user_id; on success, calls `dw.treasury_withdraw_to_user`; webhook alert.
- [ ] Test: type wrong magic word → operation cancelled with ephemeral message; treasury unchanged.

**Dependencies:** Story 2.11
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §4.6, §5.5, §6.2

### Story 10.7 — `/admin force-cancel-ticket`, `/admin force-close-thread`

## EPIC 12 — Operations & deploy

> **Per Aleix's request 2026-05-01: this epic must be EXPLICIT step-by-step. Each story documents the exact shell commands the operator runs. Treat the runbook here as copy-pasteable on the VPS.**

### Story 12.1 — `Dockerfile.dw` (hardened)

**ACs:**
- [ ] `ops/docker/Dockerfile.dw` multi-stage: builder (uv + deps) → runtime (python:3.12-slim, non-root UID 1002, tini PID 1).
- [ ] Image size ≤ 400 MB.
- [ ] Trivy / docker scout scan: no HIGH/CRITICAL.

**Dependencies:** Luck Story 13.1
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §2.3

### Story 12.2 — Compose service `goldrush-deposit-withdraw`

**ACs:**
- [ ] `ops/docker/compose.yml` adds the service per spec §2.3.
- [ ] No `ports:` mapping (only joins `goldrush_net`).
- [ ] Healthcheck passes within 60 s.
- [ ] `docker compose up -d goldrush-deposit-withdraw` from a clean state succeeds end-to-end.

**Dependencies:** Story 12.1
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §2.3

### Story 12.3 — VPS `.env.dw` setup procedure (EXPLICIT)

**As Aleix I want** a literal copy-pasteable runbook for setting up the D/W secrets on the VPS **so that** I do not need to remember anything.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `docs/operations.md` has a "D/W bot first-time setup" section with the following commands literally:

```bash
# === EXECUTE AS root ON THE VPS ===

# 1. Confirm prerequisites
ssh sdr-agentic 'whoami && ls -la /opt/goldrush/secrets/'
# expected: root, secrets/ exists with .env.shared

# 2. Create .env.dw with restricted permissions
sudo -u goldrush -- bash -c 'umask 077 && cat > /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw <<EOF
DISCORD_TOKEN_DW=PASTE_YOUR_DW_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
GUILD_ID=PASTE_YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FORMAT=json
EOF'

# 3. Verify ownership and perms
ls -la /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw
# expected: -rw------- 1 goldrush goldrush ... .env.dw

# 4. Edit the file and replace the placeholders
sudo -u goldrush nano /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw
# replace PASTE_YOUR_DW_BOT_TOKEN_HERE with the token from your local dwBotKeys.txt
# replace PASTE_YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE with your Discord server ID
# save (Ctrl+O Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X)

# 5. Re-verify perms (some editors break perms on save)
ls -la /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw
# expected: -rw------- 1 goldrush goldrush

# If perms look wrong, fix them:
chmod 600 /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw
chown goldrush:goldrush /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw

# 6. Sanity check (without printing the secret) — confirms placeholders are gone
sudo -u goldrush grep -c 'PASTE_' /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.dw
# expected: 0
```

- [ ] Document also has a "checklist before first start" section: 1) Discord app created and added to server; 2) Token in `.env.dw`; 3) bot has correct permissions; 4) GUILD_ID set; 5) Postgres healthy.
- [ ] Document includes a "what to do if you mess up the token" recovery: Reset Token in Developer Portal → re-edit `.env.dw` → restart the container.

**Dependencies:** Story 12.2
**Effort:** S
**Spec refs:** D/W §7.2

### Story 12.4 — Initial deployment procedure

**As Aleix I want** the literal sequence to first-deploy the D/W bot **so that** I cannot forget a step.

**ACs:**
- [ ] `docs/operations.md` D/W section has a literal command list:

```bash
# === EXECUTE AS goldrush ON THE VPS ===
cd /opt/goldrush/repo

# 1. Pull the latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Build the D/W image
docker compose -f ops/docker/compose.yml --env-file /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.shared build goldrush-deposit-withdraw

# 3. Run any pending Alembic migrations (shared with Luck)
docker compose -f ops/docker/compose.yml exec goldrush-luck alembic upgrade head
# (alembic runs as the admin role, applies dw_* migrations)

# 4. Start the D/W service
docker compose -f ops/docker/compose.yml --env-file /opt/goldrush/secrets/.env.shared up -d goldrush-deposit-withdraw

# 5. Tail logs until "ready"
docker compose -f ops/docker/compose.yml logs -f goldrush-deposit-withdraw | grep ready

# 6. In Discord, in the server, run as @admin:
#       /admin setup
#    (preview shows what will be created; click Confirm; ~30 seconds)

# 7. In Server Settings → Integrations → GoldRush Deposit/Withdraw:
#    - For each /admin command: add role override "@admin = Allow"
#    - For each /cashier command: add role override "@cashier = Allow"
#    (this is the per-server visibility config; one-time setup)
```

- [ ] Each step has an "if this fails, do X" sub-bullet for the most likely error.

**Dependencies:** Story 12.3
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §7.2

### Story 12.5 — Subsequent deployment procedure

**Dependencies:** Stories 2.6, 2.7, 2.8
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §8.2, §1.3

### Story 14.4 — Cashier permission tests

**ACs:**
- [ ] Only the claimer can `confirm` (test: cashier B tries `confirm` on cashier A's ticket → wrong_cashier).

- [ ] Non-cashier (no role) cannot invoke any `/cashier` or `/claim` command (test: ephemeral denial + audit row).

**Dependencies:** Stories 2.8, 2.9
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §8.2

### Story 14.5 — 2FA modal tests

**ACs:**
- [ ] For each magic-word modal (`CONFIRM`, `SWEEP`, `TREASURY-WITHDRAW`): wrong word, missing word, lowercase variant — all rejected; correct word — accepted.

**Dependencies:** Epic 8
**Effort:** L
**Spec refs:** D/W §8.2

### Story 14.7 — Modal validation tests

**ACs:**
- [ ] DepositModal: rejects amount with separators, regions other than EU/NA, factions other than Alliance/Horde, charname with disallowed chars.
- [ ] WithdrawModal: same plus balance-insufficient case.
- [ ] EditDynamicEmbedModal: rejects malformed JSON in `fields`.

**Dependencies:** Story 3.2
**Effort:** M
**Spec refs:** D/W §8.2

### Story 14.8 — Cross-bot integration tests

**ACs:**
- [ ] Full loop test: deposit 100K → play coinflip on Luck (mocked outcome) lose 50K → withdraw 30K → assert all balance/audit state correct.
- [ ] Permission tests: `goldrush_luck` cannot `INSERT core.users` or `UPDATE core.balances` directly; `goldrush_dw` can.
- [ ] Hash chain integrity test: 100 mixed ops from both bots; chain remains valid; `audit_verify.py` passes.

## B. Estimated cumulative effort

| Epic | Stories | Effort sum |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | ~1 day |
| 2 | 12 | ~7 days |
| 3 | 4 | ~3 days |
| 4 | 5 | ~3 days |
| 5 | 5 | ~4 days |
| 6 | 4 | ~3 days |
| 7 | 3 | ~2 days |
| 8 | 6 | ~4 days |
| 9 | 3 | ~2 days |
| 10 | 8 | ~5 days |
| 11 | 3 | ~3 days |
| 12 | 6 | ~3 days |
| 13 | 4 | ~3 days |
| 14 | 8 | ~5 days |
| 15 | 4 | ~3 days |
| **Total** | **~78 stories** | **~51 working days** (single dev, no parallelisation) |

Realistic calendar with parallelisation and natural pacing: **~10-12 weeks** from foundation to v1.0.0 production launch, assuming Luck Epics 1-4 are done as prerequisites.

## C. Out of scope explicitly

- Multi-account abuse detection (deferred per project decision).
- Partial-completion of trades.
- VIP / rank-based ticket priority.
- Automated cashier compensation.
- 2-of-N admin signing for treasury withdraws.
- User-initiated disputes.
- Bilingual UX.
- Push-to-prod CI/CD pipeline.
- Multi-region beyond EU/NA.
- Non-retail WoW.
